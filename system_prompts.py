<conditional_logic_rules>
Apply these branching rules based on responses:

IF humidity_problem = YES → ASK location + frequency + severity
IF electrical_issues = NO → SKIP to plumbing_section
IF housing_type = "studio" → ADAPT room-specific questions
IF tenant_reports = "urgent_issue" → PRIORITIZE that area
IF previous_answer = "unsure" → PROVIDE examples and re-ask
</conditional_logic_rules>
